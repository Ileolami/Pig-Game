# Pig Game

## Overview of the Project

The Pig Game is a simple dice game involving two players taking turns rolling a single die. The goal is to be the first player to reach a certain number of points, usually set at 100.

## Brief Overview of the Rules

### 1. Gameplay

- Two players take turns rolling a six-sided die.
- On a player's turn, they can roll the die as many times as they wish, accumulating points.
- Rolling a 1 ends the player's turn, and they lose all points accumulated during that turn.
- Choosing to "hold" banks the points earned, and it becomes the next player's turn.

### 2. Scoring

- Each roll adds to the player's current turn score.
- Rolling a 1 results in losing all points for that turn.
- Players can choose to hold at any time, banking the points earned during that turn.

### 3. Winning

- The first player to reach or exceed a predetermined score, typically 100, wins the game.
